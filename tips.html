        </h1>
        <p>1. *Sunlight*: Most flowers thrive in full sunlight, so ensure they receive adequate sunlight based on their specific requirements.<br>

            2. *Soil*: Plant flowers in well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.<br>
            
            3. *Watering*: Water your flowers regularly, ensuring the soil is moist but not waterlogged. Adjust watering frequency based on the plant's needs and the weather conditions.<br>
            
            4. *Fertilization*: Use a balanced fertilizer to provide essential nutrients for healthy growth. Follow the recommended dosage on the fertilizer package.</p>

                1. *Weeding*: Remove weeds regularly to prevent them from competing with your flowers for nutrients and water.<br>
                
                2. *Pest Control*: Keep an eye out for pests like aphids or mites. Use natural or chemical methods to control infestations.<br>
                
                3. *Mulching*: Mulch around the base of your flowers to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.<br>
                
                4. *Support*: Provide support for tall or climbing flowers to prevent them from bending or breaking.<br>
                
                5. *Protection*: Protect your flowers from strong winds, frost, or extreme weather conditions by providing shelter or covering them when necessary.</p>
